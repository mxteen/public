    "**CRISP-DM** stands for \"Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining\" and is a widely used data science methodology for developing data mining and data science projects. It consists of six major phases and each of these phases consists of several subtasks. The six major phases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Business Understanding**\n",
    "\n",
    "    In this phase, the focus is on understanding the problem or opportunity that the data science project aims to address. The main subtasks in this phase are defining the project objectives, assessing the situation, and defining the data science problem.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Understanding**\n",
    "\n",
    "    In this phase, the focus is on collecting and exploring the data that will be used in the project. The main subtasks in this phase are data collection, data description, data exploration, and data quality assessment.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Preparation**\n",
    "\n",
    "    In this phase, the focus is on preparing the data for modeling. The main subtasks in this phase are data cleaning, data integration, data transformation, and data reduction.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Modeling**\n",
    "\n",
    "    In this phase, the focus is on selecting and building the appropriate model(s) to address the data science problem. The main subtasks in this phase are model selection, model building, and model evaluation.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "    In this phase, the focus is on evaluating the model(s) built in the previous phase to determine if they meet the project objectives. The main subtasks in this phase are model evaluation and model selection.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Deployment**\n",
    "\n",
    "    In this phase, the focus is on deploying the model(s) and integrating them into the business processes. The main subtasks in this phase are deployment planning, model implementation, and monitoring and maintenance.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that these phases are not necessarily sequential and may be revisited as needed throughout the project."
